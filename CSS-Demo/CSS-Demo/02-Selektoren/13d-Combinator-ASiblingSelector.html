  <h1>Global Warming: Four Degree Warming Out Of Reach </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere
    between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average
    temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may
    be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how
    sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO2).
