    <h1>Global Warming: Four Degree Warming Out Of Reach </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere
    between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average
    temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may
    be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how
    sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO2).

    <h1>Man bites Dog </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    David Etzel, 37, faces a year or more in jail after jurors found him guilty of animal cruelty Tuesday.

    His crime was one usually not heard of outside intro to journalism classes: He bit a dog.

    All of this happened in — where else? — Florida.

    According to the Palm Beach Post, 6-foot-8, 375-pound Etzel was convicted Tuesday of biting and squeezing his mother’s tiny Shih Tzu so hard that one of the dog’s eyes popped out.

    <h1>This Year 1.35 Million People will Die in Road Traffic Crashes </h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    Every year the lives of approximately 1.35 million people are cut short as a result
    of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer
    non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.

    Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families,
    and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of
    treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries,
    and for family members who need to take time off work or school to
    care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their
    gross domestic product.
