		<h1>Tesla Model S</h1>
		<p>
			The Tesla Model S is a full-sized all-electric five-door, luxury liftback, produced by Tesla Motors, and introduced in June 2012.[10] It scored a perfect 5.0 NHTSA automobile safety rating. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official range for the 2012 Model S Performance model equipped with an 85 kWh battery pack is 265 miles (426 km), higher than any other electric car at the time.[11][12][13] EPA rates its energy consumption at 237.5 Wh per kilometer (38 kWh/100 mi) for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.64 L/100 km or 107 mpg-imp).[11][14]

			The Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country, twice leading in Norway, in September and again in December 2013;[15][16][17][18] and also in Demmark in December 2015.[19] Global Model S sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in December 2015.[20]

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The Model S was styled by Franz von Holzhausen, who previously worked for Mazda North American Operations.[26] The car was codenamed WhiteStar during research and preliminary development.[1][2][3]</p>
		<p>The Model S was announced in a press release on June 30, 2008.[27][28] The prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on March 26, 2009.[29]</p>

		<h2>Production</h2>
		<p>Tesla manufactures the Model S at the 5.4 million square foot[39] Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. For the European market, Tesla assembles and distributes from its European Distribution Center in Tilburg, the Netherlands.[40] Cars are built and tested in Fremont, California. The battery pack, the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to Tilburg, where the cars are reassembled.[41] The center occupies a 203,000 sq ft (18,900 m2) industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse. Tesla expects the Model S to "pay back" the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles (16,000 km).[42]</p>
